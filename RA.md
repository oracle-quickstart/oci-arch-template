# **Overview**

> *Don't change the section title! Write a brief overview of the business or technical goal of the reference architecture.*

# Architecture

> *Don't change the section title! In one or two short paragraphs, describe the architecture at a high level.*

The following diagram illustrates this reference architecture.

> *Insert a sketch of the architecture diagram here.*

> *The sketch can be rough. Use any tool of your choice. Draw.io is ideal, because it supports in-place editing within Confluence wiki pages. Feel free to use Visio, PowerPoint, or any other tool.*

> *You can use the templates and icons available here: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm#Graphics_for_Topologies_and_Diagrams.*

> *Drawio versions of the latest architectures published are also available in [Reference Architecture Center](https://docs.oracle.com/solutions/)   These might be useful if you prefer a “starter” image that you can customize/edit.*
